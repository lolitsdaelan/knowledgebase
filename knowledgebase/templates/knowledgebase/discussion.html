                        A sample post from the user WonderDude. WonderDude asks some really engaging question, and now it's started a full blown discussion! The potential issue here, however, is if WonderDude had asked a support question. Do we extend our support to the forums? Can anyone view the site, but only customers with an active support contract can post? Is it even possible to integrate that level of account validation? These are all good questions...

                        Another problem. HTML formatting. Users needs to be able to <b>easily</b> add in some basic text formatting. This is critical to the user experience!

                        AnotherUser was very interested in WonderDude's post, so he submitted a reply asking for more information. What does this look like when the text overflows past the image?
